1. 9
2. This class has reinforced and brought together a lot of the stuff I have been learning over the last year. I liked that the class size was small and we were able to move fast. I really enjoyed that we were able to cover a great amount of topics.

3. I don't really have any suggestions. The class was a good 1 day overiview. I was originally suppose to take this earlier in the summer but it got cancelled twice, so I've been learning more about git muyself at work and with online tutorials.
